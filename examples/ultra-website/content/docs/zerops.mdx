Use this `Dockerfile`. It is multi-stage and will both build and run the production ready app.

```dockerfile
FROM denoland/deno as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN deno task build

FROM denoland/deno
EXPOSE 8000
COPY --from=builder /app/.ultra /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["deno", "task", "start"]
```

You can modify this as needed, another possible Dockerfile assumes you commit your build artifacts, or deploy locally from built files.

```dockerfile
FROM denoland/deno
EXPOSE 8000
WORKDIR /app
COPY .ultra /app
CMD ["deno", "task", "start"]
```
